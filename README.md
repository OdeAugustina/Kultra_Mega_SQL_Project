Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) deals in office supplies and furniture, supplying individual consumers, small businesses, and large corporate clients across Nigeria. The purpose of this project is to analyze KMS sales data from 2019-2012 from the  Abuja division using Microsoft SQL Server. The aim is to uncover actionable insights and make data-driven decisions that drive Performance, improve shipping costs, and customer relationships.

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparations, I perform the following actions;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing Variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting


### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
The objective of this analysis is to explore, summarize key patterns and trends in the KMS data by answering the following important questions:
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method, and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer




### DATA ANALYSIS
I used SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server to extract, aggregate, and interpret key business metrics from historical order data (2009-2012). The analysis provides an understanding of the sales performance, customer behavior, and overall operational efficiency across the different product categories, regions, customer segments, shipping modes, and shipping methods.
Key findings included: 
- The best-performing products category and top/bottom regions in sales
- Understand Customer Profitability
     - Identify the valuable and least performing customers
- Evaluate the shipping cost and how it relates to the different shipping modes.
